```python
legally_impossible = kv.most_similar(positive=['Legally Blonde', 'Mission: Impossible'])
```

Passing in two positive examples, `m1` and `m2`, finds the vectors that are most similar to `m1 + m2`. Semantically, this corresponds to movies that are about halfway between `m1` and `m2` in terms of meaning. 

In light of this interpretation, some of our `legally_impossible` results make a lot of sense. *Miss Congeniality*, *Mr. & Mrs. Smith*, and *Charlie's Angels* are all examples of movies that combine the "chick flick comedy" properties of *Legally Blonde* with the action/spy movie properties of *Mission: Impossible*.

What happens if we run something like `kv.most_similar(positive=['Legally Blonde', 'Legally Blonde'])`? We get the exact same results as `kv.most_similar('Legally Blonde')`. The reason comes down to our use of cosine distance. If we add a movie vector `m1` to itself, we get a vector that's twice as long, but its *angle* remains the same. So for any pair of movies `m1`, `m2`, `distance.cosine(m1, m2) == distance.cosine(m1+m1, m2)`.

'''We have some movies whose embeddinging norms are 0 or very close to it - they also seem to be among the movies with the fewest ratings in the dataset.
This is consistent with what we'd expect from a model trained with an L2 weight penalty on embeddings - there's a cost to increasing an embedding's size.
Memorizing some properties of an obscure movie that only occurs once or twice in the dataset won't do much to decrease our overall error - so it's not worth 
paying the regularization cost.

On the other hand, the movies with the biggest embeddings are *not* necessarily the ones with the most ratings in the dataset. There's a strong trend of very
low average ratings in the list. Can you think of why this would be?
