def menu_is_boring(meals):

        if meals[i] == meals[i+1]:
            return True
    return False
```

The key to our solution is the call to `range`. `range(len(meals))` would give us all the indices of `meals`. If we had used that range, the last iteration of the loop would be comparing the last element to the element after it, which is... `IndexError`! `range(len(meals)-1)` gives us all the indices except the index of the last element.

But don't we need to check if `meals` is empty? Turns out that `range(0) == range(-1)` - they're both empty. So if `meals` has length 0 or 1, we just won't do any iterations of our for loop.
