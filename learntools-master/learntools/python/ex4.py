Here's a non-obvious solution using only tools shown in the tutorial notebook:
```python
def count_negatives(nums):
    nums.append(0)
    # We could also have used the list.sort() method, which modifies a list, putting it in sorted order.
    nums = sorted(nums)
    return nums.index(0)
```

The above implementation relies on the fact that `list.index` returns the index of the *first* occurrence of a value. (You can verify this by calling `help(list.index)`.) So if, after sorting the list in ascending order, the value 0 is at index 0, then the number of negatives is 0. If 0 is at index 2 (i.e. the third element), then there are two elements smaller than 0. And so on.

*Note*: it's usually considered "impolite" to modify a list that someone passes to your function without giving them some warning (i.e. unless the docstring says that it modifies its input). So, if we wanted to be nice, we could have started by making a copy of nums using the `list.copy()` method (e.g. `our_nums = nums.copy()`), and then working with that copy rather than the original.

If you're a big Lisp fan, you might have written this technically compliant solution (we haven't talked about recursion, but I guess this doesn't use any syntax or functions we haven't seen yet...):

```python
def count_negatives(nums):
    # Equivalent to "if len(nums) == 0". An empty list is 'falsey'.
    if not nums:
        return 0
    else:
        # Implicitly converting a boolean to an int! See question 6 of the
        # exercise on booleans and conditionals
        return (nums[0] < 0) + count_negatives(nums[1:])
```"""
