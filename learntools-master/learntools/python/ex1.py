`7-3` is of course just 3 subtracted from 7: 4. The key is what happens when we add another `-`.

`7--3` is `10`. To match how Python evaluates this expression, we would parenthesize it as `7-(-3)`. The first `-` is treated as a subtraction operator, but the second one is treated as *negation*. We're subtracting negative 3 (which is equivalent to adding 3). Subsequent `-`s are all treated as additional negations, so they cause the subtracted quantity to flip back and forth between 3 and negative 3. Therefore, when there are an odd number of `-`s, the expression equals 4. When there's an even number, the expression equals 10.

Calculating `rows` is the trickiest part. Here's another way of doing it:
```python
rows = (n + 7) // 8```
We haven't shown the `math` module, but if you're familiar with the ceiling function, you might find this approach more intuitive:
```python
import math
rows = math.ceil(n / 8)
rows = int(rows) # ceil returns a float```

b = <expression>
a = b```""",

    _solution = """The one-line syntax results in `a` and `b` having the same memory address - i.e. they refer to the same object. This matters if that object is of a **mutable** type, like list. Consider the following code:
```python
odds = evens = []
for i in range(5):
    if (i % 2) == 0:
        evens.append(i)
    else:
        odds.append(i)
print(odds)
print(evens)```

We might expect this would print `[1, 3]`, then `[0, 2, 4]`. But actually, it will print `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` twice in a row. `evens` and `odds` refer to the same object, so appending an element to one of them appends it to both of them. This is occasionally the source of hair-pulling debugging sessions. :)

Another consideration is expressions that have side effects. For example, `list.pop` is a method which removes and returns the final element of a list. If we have `L = [1, 2, 3]`, then `a = b = L.pop()`, will result in `a` and `b` both having a value of 3. But running `a = L.pop()`, then `b = L.pop()` will result in `a` having value 3 and `b` having value 2.
