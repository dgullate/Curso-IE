    _solution = '''Luigi used the variable name `i` to represent each item in racer['items'].
However, he also used `i` as the loop variable for the outer loop (`for i in range(len(racers))`).
These i's are clobbering each other. This becomes a problem only if we encounter a racer
with a finish of 1 and a name of `None`. If that happens, when we try to print the "WARNING" message,
`i` refers to a string like "green shell", which python can't add to an integer, hence a `TypeError`.

This is similar to the issue we saw when we imported * from `math` and `numpy`. They both contained variables called `log`, and the one we got when we tried to call it was the wrong one.

We can fix this by using different loop variables for the inner and outer loops. `i` wasn't a very
good variable name for the inner loop anyways. `for item in racer['items']` fixes the bug and is 
easier to read.

Variable shadowing bugs like this don't come up super often, but when they do they can take an infuriating amount of time to diagnose!
