`learntools.core` contains the basic elements of exercise checking, shared across all Learn micro-courses and exercises.

The remaining sub-packages correspond to Kaggle Learn courses in various stages of development.

## Live

The following sub-packages correspond to courses that are live at https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview

## Deprecated

- `advanced_pandas`: Old checking code for the Pandas course (predating the existence of `learntools.core` infrastructure)
- `ml_insights`: Previous name used (during the 4-day-challenge launch) for what is now `ml_explainability` (this is just a symlink to `ml_explainability`)
