"""
Some assertion helpers used in Problem.check implementations.

TODO: standardize on some conventions for how these helpers are called, and how they
present information to the user:
    - When showing actual/expected values, do we use the result of str() or repr()?
        - (Should we truncate the representation in case it's huge?)
    - When showing types, str or repr?

    Assert helpers marked with this decorator take a "name" argument, which is a
    markdown string describing the actual value being checked. It may be a generic
    name like "dataframe", or a prose description like "the result of calling `circle_area`",
    or a variable name wrapped in backticks.

    The latter case is extremely common, so this decorator adds an optional "var" keyword-arg
    to the function. Passing var="foo" is a convenient shorthand for name="`foo`". (If you
    pass a value for "var", you should not also pass a value for "name".)

    Example:

    @name_or_var
    def assert_negative(actual, name):
        assert actual < 0, "{} should have been negative, but was actually {}".format(name, actual)

    # The following are all valid calls
    assert_negative(x, "Bank balance")
    assert_negative(x, name="`Bank.balance` attribute")
    assert_negative(x, var="bank_balance") # Equivalent to assert_negative(x, "`bank_balance`")
