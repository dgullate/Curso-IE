    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use **pipelines** to clean up your modeling code.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pipelines** are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized.  Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "1. **Cleaner Code:** Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy.  With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n",
    "2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale.  We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "4. **More Options for Model Validation:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`. "
