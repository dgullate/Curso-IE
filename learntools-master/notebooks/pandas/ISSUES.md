- None of the lessons seem to cover modifying dataframes, which is pretty important.
    - Adding a column to a dataframe
    - Inplace operations like resetting index, dropping null values, renaming
- Would benefit from at least one example where index labels aren't just range(n)
- How many records have condition X?
- Would be fun to change up the format of questions sometimes. e.g.
    - Give them a broken pandas expression and have them fix it
    - Write a function that works with arbitrary dataframes/serieses
    - 'pepper' questions
- iterating over dfs/series (I know, anathema to pandas purists, but sometimes it's just the path of least resistance)
- `reset_index`/`set_index` could use a slightly more in-depth treatment
- Currently no problems have hints. Worth adding some to trickier questions.
- Summary functions and maps 'centered points' question is an exact dupe of something shown in ref notebook, which is not ideal.
- Summary functions and maps reference: should maybe briefly show using df.apply returning a series (rather than df) to prepare them for q7 in the workbook.
