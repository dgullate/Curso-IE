    "When performing operations on a dataset we will sometimes need to combine different `DataFrame` and/or `Series` in non-trivial ways. `pandas` has three core methods for doing this. In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`. Most of what `merge` can do can also be done more simply with `join`, so I will omit it and focus on the first two functions here.\n",

One example: the [YouTube Videos dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use `concat` to smush them together:"
