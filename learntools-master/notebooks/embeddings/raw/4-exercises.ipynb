This can give us some intuition about how our model works, what latent features it thinks are useful, whether adding certain additional data explicitly might improve the model's accuracy, and so on.\n",

You can browse the colormaps that ship with matplotlib [here](https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html). Do different colormaps offer different insights into the data? What if you use one of the \"qualitative colormaps\"?\n",

In the case of year, the earliest movie in our dataset is from 1902, but there are very few movies in the first few decades of the 20th century. Would our results be easier to interpret if we started our colormap at 1930 or 1940? Give it a try. Hint: check out the `norm` argument to [`ax.scatter`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter.html) and the documentation for [`matplotlib.colors.Normalize`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.colors.Normalize.html#matplotlib.colors.Normalize).\n",
    "- Can you identify any exceptions to the overall trend in your graph? Try zooming in on the area of an anomaly and looking at the labels of the points. How many movies make up the anomaly? Do you have a hypothesis about why our algorithm would have placed them there?
