    "We look up an embedding vector for the movie and user, concatenate them together. Then we add some hidden layers. Finally these come together at a single output node to predict a rating.\n",

    "In this lesson, I'll show a simpler architecture for solving the same problem: **matrix factorization**. And simpler can be a very good thing! Sometimes a simple model will converge quickly to an adequate solution, where a more complicated model might overfit or fail to converge.\n",

    "Let's review a bit of math. If you're a linear algebra pro, feel free to skip this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of two length-$n$ vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_ib_i=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\\cdots+a_nb_n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a single scalar number (not a vector).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is only defined for vectors *of the same length*. This means we need to use the same size for movie embeddings and user embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, suppose we've trained embeddings of size 4, and the movie *Twister* is represented by the vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{m_{Twister}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & -0.5 & 0.3 & -0.1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the user Stanley is represented by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{u_{Stanley}} = \\begin{bmatrix} -0.2 & 1.5 & -0.1 & 0.9 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What rating do we think Stanley will give to *Twister*? We can calculate our model's output as:\n",

    "\\ \\mathbf{m_{Twister}} \\cdot \\mathbf{u_{Stanley}} &= (1.0 \\cdot -0.2) + (-0.5 \\cdot 1.5) + (0.3 \\cdot -0.1) + (-0.1 \\cdot 0.9) \\\\\n",
    "&= -1.07\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're training on a a centered version of the rating column, our model's output is on a scale where 0 = the overall average rating in the training set (about 3.5). So we predict that Stanley will give *Twister* $3.5 + (-1.07) = 2.43$ stars."

    "# Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an intuitive interpretation that supports the decision to combine our embedding vectors in this way. Suppose the dimensions of our movie embedding space correspond to the following axes of variation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dimension 1: How action-packed?\n",
    "- Dimension 2: How romantic?\n",
    "- Dimension 3: How mature is the intended audience?\n",
    "- Dimension 4: How funny is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, *Twister*, an action-packed disaster movie, has a positive value of 1.0 for $m_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this imply about the meaning of our user vectors? Remember that $m_1u_1$ is one of the terms we add up to get our predicted rating. So if $u_1$ is 1.0, it will increase our predicted rating by 1 star (vs. $u_1 = 0$). If $u_1 = .5$, our predicted rating goes up half a star. If $u_1$ is -1, our predicted rating goes down a star.\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain terms $u_1$ tells us 'how does this user feel about action?'. Do they love it? Hate it? Or are they indifferent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanley's vector tells us he's a big fan of romance and comedy, and slightly dislikes action and mature content. What if we give him a movie that's similar to the last one except that it has lots of romance?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{m_{Titanic}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 1.1 & 0.3 & -0.1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not hard to predict how this affects our rating output. We're giving Stanley more of what he likes, so his predicted rating increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\ \\mathrm{predicted\\_rating(Stanley, Titanic)} &= \\mathbf{m_{Titanic}} \\cdot \\mathbf{u_{Stanley}} + 3.5 \\\\\n",
    "&= (1.0 \\cdot -0.2) + (1.1 \\cdot 1.5) + (0.3 \\cdot -0.1) + (-0.1 \\cdot 0.9) + 3.5 \\\\\n",
    "&= 4.83 \\text{ stars}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Aside:** In practice, the meaning of the dimensions of our movie embeddings will not be quite so clear-cut, but it remains true that the meaning of our movie embedding space and user embedding space are fundamentally tied together: $u_i$ will always represent \"how much does this user like movies that have the quality represented by $m_i$?\". (Hopefully this also gives some more intuition for why the movie embedding space and user embedding space have to be the same size for this technique.)\n",
