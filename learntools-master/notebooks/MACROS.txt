All macro invocations begin with # followed by the macro name bracketed by a delimeter which determines the macro's type/scope. 

- 'Expanding' macros are bracketed with $ e.g. #$TUTORIAL_URL(5)$
- Line-level macros are bracketed with _ e.g. #_COMMENT_IF(PROD)_
- Cell-level macros are bracketed with %% e.g. #%%RM%%
    - (Exception: HIDE* macros, for historical reasons)

## Expanding macros

cf. nb_utils/lesson_preprocessor.py methods

NEXT_NOTEBOOK_URL

# N in the signatures below is the number of the corresponding lesson (starting from 1)
# Unless you are referencing a previous lesson, you should typically use NEXT_NOTEBOOK_URL instead
TUTORIAL_URL(N)
EXERCISE_URL(N)
EXERCISE_FORKING_URL(N)
# With no argument, we take N to be the current lesson.
EXERCISE_FORKING_URL

# Some standard boilerplate for beginning and ending exercises/tutorials.
KEEP_GOING
EXERCISE_PREAMBLE
YOURTURN

## Line-level macros

cf. nb_utils/line_macros.py

(Many of these can also be used as cell-level macros)

- COMMENT
- UNCOMMENT
- COMMENT_IF(condition)
- UNCOMMENT_IF(condition)
- RM
- RM_IF(condition)

Valid conditions:
- PROD (i.e. testing=false in track_config.yaml)

## Cell-level macros

cf. nb_utils/macro_processing.py (and nb_utils/lesson_preprocess.py for hide macros)

# Used at the top of a code cell. Equivalent to the "hide output" / "hide input" buttons in the Kaggle Kernels UI.
HIDE_INPUT
HIDE_OUTPUT
# Hide both input and output
HIDE

- RM_BELOW

## Common use cases

```
#_COMMENT_IF(PROD)_
q3.solution()
```

The above is a common pattern. When testing an exercise, we want to be able to easily run calls to `.hint()` and `.solution()`, but in the production notebook we serve to users, we want these calls to start commented (so they need to put in a small amount of effort to peek, and won't accidentally get spoiled if they run all cells)

```
#%%RM_IF(PROD)%%
# [some example solution code (correct or incorrect)
q3.check()
```

Useful for testing checking logic against sample solutions. When creating the production notebook to ship to users, we should remove these cells entirely.
